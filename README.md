Smith-Waterman Processor

This program applies three seperate scoring algorithm to 2 sequence string.

- Matrix 1: a traditional scoring algorithm with match, mismatch, and gap scores
- Matrix 2: an advanced scoring algorithm with match, mismatch, gap, and gap exstension scores
- Matrix 3: a new scoring algorithm with match, mismatch, gap, gap exstension scores, AND match exstention multipliers

By having match extensions, this encourages tracebacks with more sequential matches
